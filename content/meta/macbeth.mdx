# "Why, Macbeth!"

My initial reaction to Macbeth's killing of his best friend and companion in battle, Banquo was one of confusion. Why? I pondered: "Surely no one in their
right mind would do such a thing!" From an outsider's perspective, as merely a spectator what should be done after Macbeth's rash regicide was obvious: he should lay low, 
don't pour gasoline the flames of trouble and you won't get burnt.

However, what I, and many readers of Macbeth had failed to realize at the time is that the genius of this Shakespearian work lays percisely in this confusion.

## Slave of a prophecy

Macbeth knows the prophecy all too well: He wants to prevent it from coming true. If he was King, and Banquo were to be the father of kings, the only two ways things would pan out is if he hiumself were to beousted from monarchy, or 
he would fail to produce and sons. Somehow knowing the latter isn't the case, Macbeth decides to onece again make himself an instrument of the whitches' predictions, however this timetrying to prevent their claims from coming true. Speaking 
strictly in terms of plot, this was his first mistake. If he really trusted the whiches enough to assume their prophecy were to come true having just two correct, fulfilled claims,
he was bound to make the connection that the whiches' prophecies coming true were only thanks to his engagement. 

However, Macbeth here is a victim of the prophecy, or more accurately, he is powerless in the face of events that will happen in the future,
There is a thought experiment about a <Inline href="https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a">button, or device called a "predictor"</Inline>. This button will flash it's light five seconds before you press it, no matter what. 
People have tried outsmarting it and have gone mad. The question it poses is one of whether we truely possess free will: are we truely at the reigns of our actions, or is every "decision" that we make
already carefully choosen out well beforehand in a careful orchestration of variables?

Macbeth's situation here is very similar. He is trying to outsmart the device, and has gone mad.
