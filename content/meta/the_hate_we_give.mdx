 I was the only light-skinned kid in my class where I attended <Inline href="https://www.laurelridgees.dekalb.k12.ga.us/">kindergarden</Inline>. Yet, I never noticed. I never given much thought to the fact that the esteemed George Washington Carver was a black scientist, or that you’d be hard-pressed to find a scraggly homeless man on the streets of downtown Atlanta that wasn’t black. No, “never given much thought” isn’t the correct phrase. I never even noticed.  

Now, don’t get me wrong; I’m not colorblind. Take the word colorblind and toss it around to arrive at my race policy: Blind to color. At least, that was how I viewed and treated my relationships and the world until summer of 2020. We all are much too familiar with the news of the George Floyd incident and the ensuing BLM riots.  

            These events ultimately served as a huge catalyst to the societal phenomena touted as the “social justice movement”, where discussion regarding race and ethnicity are now a staple of the ESG-funded workplace as well as the very school I attend. Unfortunately, I was a naïve middle schooler who often took an analytical and statistical view of any issue regardless of social consequences. I would respond to someone claiming “Black people are systemically oppressed by society” with a rebuttal along the lines of “How can you show that quantitatively? Where is the main causation and effect?” This was often met with frowns across the room.

My peers often possess strong yet sensitive beliefs of many “social justice” issues. I commend them for wanting to believe and act on the right thing. However, I was either playing Devil’s Advocate in their minds, or they ended up believing that I’m a hateful, racist person whom should not be allowed to have relationships.  

When people are very deeply attached to an issue and hold strong beliefs, they are very defensive of them as well. Defensive also means any opposing opinion is seen as an attack; also known as offensive. Interpreting my attempts to reach non-emotional, real and logical points as hatred, bigotry and racism was sadly what most of my peers did. The latter belief as described. 

*The Hate U Give* provide a genius example of this kind of polarized thinking, and overcorrection of bias. Not just in the book itself, but in how people are seen to intewrpret the book. 
The overwhelmihngly negative sentiment towards the story of White police officer number 115 shows exactly this sort of "double-standard" that many innocent people fall victim to. 

In the name of equality, we as a society have given rise to the so-called "protected classes". Although the <Inline href="https://oshr.nc.gov/state-employee-resources/diversity-inclusion/resources/types-discrimination#:~:text=Protected%20classes%20for%20the%20laws,sex%2C%20religion%20and%20national%20origin">codified</Inline> and legal discription as that noone can discrimiate based on a few general categories, in reality it has been unfairly leveraged by just a few minority groups. Now there are certain peoples whom society deems is absolutely unacceptable to mistreat as it wqould be okay to do so to someone white because "they have been historically privileged". 
Screams unequal, doesn't it?

In the very recently modern era of mass information exchange, we are devaluing realism and the severity of words. It is concerning to me that merit-based school admissions or even math itself can be called the word “racist”. It is even more concerning to me that an analytical realist can be told that “…[he] should die alone” and the same person fails to produce a single instance of an act of prejudice by that person. I’m talking about me of course.  

            I see this not only in my personal life, but from the perspective of an onlooker as well. I’ve seen people get their lives ruined over false accusations because “it would be sexist to side with the man, right?” In this time of political and social polarization, what we need more than anything else is to go back to making our decisions based on evidence.  The only way to achieve true equality is if we collectively agree to take a step back and set some ground rules based on reality, and interpret others' actions realistically as well without antagonizing nobody.
