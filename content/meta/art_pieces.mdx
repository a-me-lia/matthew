# 1: *Tantalus*, by Gioacchino Assereto

<Image src="/tantalus2.jpg" caption="Gioacchino Assereto, (1625/35-1676)"></Image>

Tantalus, in greek myth was the son of Zeus and Plouto. He was condemned to spend eternity in a shallow pool, right out of reach of a fruit tree and the water receeding ever so slightly as to make it impossible for him to quench his thirst. 
The modern word tantalize actually comes from his name. 


The reason this specific painting is at the top of my list is because the past few months, a good chunk of my life relates directly to his sufferring. Wether being just out of reach of a 
groundbreaking career opportuinity due to my age, or (more closely resembling the plight of Tantalus), having hours of free time at school where there is unfortunately no choice but to 
be surrounded by everyday conversation, exciting and ignorant life in which I'm not welcomed.

Hundreds of people, all painted in a "live" style where each and every person is depicted as actively doing something rather than frozen in place, as well as
tens of boats, vendors and houses come together to make what *Along the River on the Qingming Festival* so unique. 

What many people consider to be the centerpiece and crowing jewel of the work is the arch bridge and the sinking boat just under it. Many poems and stories have been written about
just the sinking ship and the people hollering on the bridge above, truely a testament to both the expertise and inspiration
of Zhang Zeduan.
