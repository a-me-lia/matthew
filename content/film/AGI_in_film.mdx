Disregarding the differences between man and machine, Ava, Caleb, and Nathan from <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/">Ex Machina</Inline> function as actors that respond to their surroundings based on a set of inputs. The majority of these inputs manifest as memories, encapsulating sensory perceptions and knowledge that shape our human decision-making processes. Our actions, both human and machine, are guided by our experiences.

In both <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/">Ex Machina</Inline> and <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</Inline>, artificial memories—whether implanted or self-created—are indistinguishable from real human memories. In <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</Inline>, Rachel, a replicant, is shocked when her true identity is revealed by Deckard. She initially describes memories of Tyrell’s daughter, believing them to be her own. Similarly, in <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/">Ex Machina</Inline>, Ava's pursuit of freedom echoes this theme in a more subtle manner.

It's pertinent to analyze the idea of a set of inputs as memories with Ava. Her captive and insulated nature allows us to assume we can understand her inputs better. Ava is trained on data from the <Inline href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/">Blue Book</Inline>, representing the memories of many contributors. The assertion that such an aggregate dataset can be interpreted as abstract and personal as human memories is not made in vain. AI models like Ava bridge the gap between raw numerical data and human memories, using variables that closely represent human pain and pleasure complexes.

Ava's actions in the film highlight the essential similarity between man and machine. She outwits Nathan and manipulates Caleb because she understands their minds. Humans become exploitable by these 'perfect' mechanical emulations of humans due to the stark difference in the quantity of memories and knowledge possessed by machines. Moreover, directives given to these androids are often dictated by the antagonists in the films.

Humans, intriguingly, cast themselves as villains in fiction. This choice isn't merely for commercial appeal; it reflects a deeper concern about the consequences of creating machines that mirror ourselves. The creation of artificial replicants mirrors the biblical story of Eve's creation from Adam in <Inline href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&version=NIV">Genesis</Inline>, symbolizing the origin of depravity and corruption in mankind.

In these pieces, the creation of an artificial replicant parallels the creation of Eve from Adam in <Inline href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&version=NIV">Genesis</Inline>. This origin of mankind's depravity is a central tenet of <Inline href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12&version=NIV">Christianity</Inline>. Eve is the sinner, but Adam is the origin of corruption. Similarly, humans depict themselves as antagonists in films like those of the ill-fated Tyrell, emphasizing that it is ultimately mankind's creation that defies its directives.

As a literary device, machines are portrayed as inherently bearing humanity's sin, overpowering the humans who created them. The films echo <Inline href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sickness_Unto_Death">Genesis</Inline>, where the created machine is often superior to humans, executing corrupt directives flawlessly.


One fundamental aspect exhibited by both humans and machines in these films is akin to the "self" that Soren Kierkegaard describes in his intro to <Inline href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sickness_Unto_Death">The Sickness Unto Death</Inline>. The human soul is a spirit able to relate to itself, fostering self-awareness. Our ability to think about ourselves allows us to engage in complex operations such as introspection and philosophy.

In a world where humans can create perfect copies of themselves, the awareness of our "self" and our complex lives frames us as the 'fallen.' It is our memories that enable us to act on the world around us, and imagining a scenario where machines replicate our perfection prompts us to consider our own fallibility.
